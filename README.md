    An awesome site to look up current weather in a city and future weather!

<h2 align="center"> Description</h2>

For my Challenge, I was tasked with making JavaScript functional weather page. It includes search bar and cards for informations. as well as a history to look at previously searched cities.
Making my weather page wasnt too bad since were doing a project thats very similar. Working with for loops has mostly been new to me and its been super usefull to loop over repetative tasks.I learned a lot from putting the weather site, mostly sifting through api calls and attaching them to the page.
